- ✅ Phaser 3 installation (v3.90.0) with TypeScript
- ✅ Vite build system configuration with hot reload
- ✅ Development server running on localhost:8080

## What's Left to Build

### Immediate Setup Tasks (Week 1)
- [ ] **Project Initialization**
  - Initialize package.json with project metadata
  - Install Phaser 3 and core dependencies
  - Configure build system (Vite recommended for Phaser 3)
  - Create basic HTML entry point
  - Set up development server with hot reload

### Foundation Phase (Weeks 1-2)
- [x] **Core Architecture**
  - ✅ Scene management system (Boot, Preloader, MainMenu, Game, GameOver)
  - ✅ Asset loading pipeline with placeholder graphics generation
  - ✅ Input management abstraction (keyboard + mobile)
  - ⏸️ Basic save/load system structure (deferred to later phase)

- [x] **Player Controller Foundation**
  - ✅ Basic sprite rendering (brown pot placeholder)
  - ✅ Physics body setup with Arcade physics (gravity: 800)
  - ✅ Input handling for movement (arrow keys + WASD + mobile touch)
  - ✅ Camera following system with smooth lerp

### Movement Mechanics (Weeks 2-4)
- [x] **Basic Platforming** ✅ **COMPLETE**
  - ✅ Single jump mechanics with proper state management
  - ✅ Ground detection and anti-infinite-jump system
  - ✅ Platform collision detection and response
  - ✅ Cross-platform input (keyboard: arrows/space, mobile: touch buttons)
  - [ ] Variable jump mechanics (hold for higher jump)
  - [ ] Coyote time implementation (~120ms)
  - [ ] Jump buffering (~120ms)
  - [ ] Wall slide and wall hop mechanics

- [ ] **Resource Systems**
  - Moisture meter implementation and visual display
  - Durability system with crack visualization
  - Resource drain mechanics (time, heat, impacts)
  - Resource restoration systems

### First Playable (Weeks 4-6)
- [ ] **Basic Level System**
  - Tilemap integration for level design
  - Platform collision system
  - Simple test level creation
  - Collectible placement and pickup

- [ ] **Core Abilities (First 2)**
  - Thornspike (ground pound) - breaks brittle blocks
  - Glideleaf (gliding) - reduced gravity while held
  - Ability system framework (cooldowns, resource costs)
  - Visual feedback for ability usage

### Vertical Slice (Weeks 6-12)
- [ ] **Complete Level Set**
  - Backyard Garden 1-1, 1-2 (onboarding levels)
  - Rooftops 2-1 (introducing wind and verticality)
  - All 6 core abilities implemented
  - Waypost checkpoint system

- [ ] **Systems Integration**
  - Loadout system (soil types, passives, abilities)
  - Herbarium v1 (collectible species tracking)
  - Basic cosmetics system
  - Mobile controls implementation
