**Technical Implementation Status**: ✅ **Production Ready Foundation**

**Completed Deliverables**:
- ✅ **Product Requirements Document** - Comprehensive game design specification
- ✅ **Memory Bank** - Complete project context documentation
- ✅ **Project Planning** - Clear development roadmap established
- ✅ **Foundation Platformer** - Working game with player movement, physics, and controls

**Development Infrastructure**: ✅ **Complete**
- ✅ Node.js project setup with proper package.json
- ✅ Phaser 3 installation (v3.90.0) with TypeScript
- ✅ Vite build system configuration with hot reload
- ✅ Development server running on localhost:8080

## What's Left to Build

### Immediate Setup Tasks (Week 1)
- [ ] **Project Initialization**
  - Initialize package.json with project metadata
  - Install Phaser 3 and core dependencies
  - Configure build system (Vite recommended for Phaser 3)
  - Create basic HTML entry point
  - Set up development server with hot reload

### Foundation Phase (Weeks 1-2)
- [x] **Core Architecture**
  - ✅ Scene management system (Boot, Preloader, MainMenu, Game, GameOver)
  - ✅ Asset loading pipeline with placeholder graphics generation
  - ✅ Input management abstraction (keyboard + mobile)
  - ⏸️ Basic save/load system structure (deferred to later phase)

- [x] **Player Controller Foundation**
  - ✅ Basic sprite rendering (brown pot placeholder)
  - ✅ Physics body setup with Arcade physics (gravity: 800)
  - ✅ Input handling for movement (arrow keys + WASD + mobile touch)
  - ✅ Camera following system with smooth lerp

### Movement Mechanics (Weeks 2-4)
- [x] **Basic Platforming** ✅ **COMPLETE**
  - ✅ Single jump mechanics with proper state management
  - ✅ Ground detection and anti-infinite-jump system
  - ✅ Platform collision detection and response
  - ✅ Cross-platform input (keyboard: arrows/space, mobile: touch buttons)

- [x] **Advanced Movement Mechanics** ✅ **COMPLETE**
  - ✅ Variable jump mechanics (hold spacebar for higher jumps with diminishing returns)
  - ✅ Coyote time implementation (40ms grace period after leaving platforms)
  - ✅ Jump buffering (180ms window for early jump inputs before landing)
  - ✅ Wall slide mechanics (60px/s speed cap when holding toward wall while airborne)

- [x] **Resource Systems** ✅ **COMPLETE**
  - ✅ Moisture meter with diegetic visual ring around player (color-coded: green→yellow→red)
  - ✅ Durability system with HUD pips visualization (4 brown circles, gray when empty)
  - ✅ Moisture drain mechanics (5% every 10 seconds, respawn at 0%)
  - ✅ Impact damage system (hard landings >300px/s after 300ms airtime reduce durability)
  - ✅ Resource restoration via respawn (50% moisture, full durability)

### First Playable (Weeks 4-6)
- [x] **Basic Level System** ✅ **COMPLETE**
  - ✅ Expanded test level with multiple climbing routes (left tower, center zigzag, right mega tower)
  - ✅ Platform collision system working perfectly
  - ✅ Camera system with world bounds (2048x1024) and player following
  - ✅ Safety systems (auto-respawn, invisible boundary walls)
  - [ ] Collectible placement and pickup

- [ ] **Core Abilities (First 2)**
  - Thornspike (ground pound) - breaks brittle blocks
  - Glideleaf (gliding) - reduced gravity while held
  - Ability system framework (cooldowns, resource costs)
  - Visual feedback for ability usage

### Vertical Slice (Weeks 6-12)
- [ ] **Complete Level Set**
  - Backyard Garden 1-1, 1-2 (onboarding levels)
  - Rooftops 2-1 (introducing wind and verticality)
  - All 6 core abilities implemented
  - Waypost checkpoint system

- [ ] **Systems Integration**
  - Loadout system (soil types, passives, abilities)
  - Herbarium v1 (collectible species tracking)
  - Basic cosmetics system
  - Mobile controls implementation
