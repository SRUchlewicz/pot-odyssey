  - ✅ Visual feedback framework (HUD indicators, console logs)

- [x] **Thornspike (Ground Pound)**
  - ✅ Downward slam attack with Ctrl key/mobile down arrow
  - ✅ Brittle block destruction system
  - ✅ Visual feedback (screen shake, console logs)
  - ✅ Cooldown system (1 second)
  - ✅ Proper collision handling (one block per ground pound)

- [x] **Glideleaf (Gliding)**
  - ✅ Reduced fall speed with Q key/mobile Q button
  - ✅ Moisture drain during gliding (0.5/s)
  - ✅ Visual feedback (cyan HUD indicator, console logs)
  - ✅ Integration with existing movement system

### Next Development Options
