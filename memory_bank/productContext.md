# Product Context - Pot Odyssey

## Why This Project Exists

**Core Vision**: A cozy exploration platformer that brings fresh mechanics to the 2D platformer genre through the unique lens of playing as a sentient flowerpot searching for the "Perfect Plant."

**Market Gap**: The project addresses the need for accessible, cozy platformers that combine tight movement mechanics with meaningful progression that doesn't rely on grinding or complex combat systems.

## What Problems It Solves

### Player Experience Problems
- **Accessibility in Platformers**: Traditional platformers often exclude players due to difficulty spikes or complex controls
- **Meaningful Progression**: Many games rely on power creep or grinding; this game uses ability diversity from seed-grown plants
- **Cross-Platform Gaming**: Need for quality browser games that work on both desktop and mobile without compromise
- **Short Session Gaming**: Players want engaging experiences that fit 10-25 minute sessions

### Technical Problems
- **Browser Performance**: Delivering 60fps platforming in web browsers across device ranges
- **Input Consistency**: Providing responsive controls on both desktop and mobile platforms
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Graceful degradation from WebGL to Canvas while maintaining gameplay quality

## How It Should Work

### Core Experience Flow
1. **Exploration Phase**: Navigate diverse biomes as a sentient flowerpot, managing Moisture resource
2. **Collection Phase**: Gather seeds and environmental samples while solving light platforming puzzles
3. **Growth Phase**: Plant seeds on Planter Pads to unlock new traversal abilities
4. **Mastery Phase**: Use new abilities to access previously unreachable areas and routes

### Key Mechanics Integration
- **Pot Physics**: Weight, moisture, and durability affect movement and create risk/reward decisions
- **Ability Ecosystem**: 8+ seed-grown abilities (Glideleaf, Tanglevine, Thornspike, etc.) unlock new routes and puzzle solutions
- **Resource Management**: Moisture system creates tension without being punishing
- **Checkpoint Strategy**: Waypost Sprouts provide player agency in checkpoint placement

### Success Metrics
- **Feel**: Tight, responsive platforming with coyote time and jump buffering
- **Depth**: Multiple routes and hidden areas reward exploration and mastery
- **Accessibility**: Assist options and input customization for broad player inclusion
- **Replayability**: Time trials, collectibles, and New Game+ provide long-term engagement

### Business Model
- **Premium with Demo**: Full experience purchase with optional free demo levels
- **Platform Strategy**: Browser-first for maximum accessibility
- **Content Strategy**: 5 biomes + boss level, targeting 4-6 hour core experience with 100% completion extending to 8-10 hours
