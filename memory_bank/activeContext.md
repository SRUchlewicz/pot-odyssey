# Active Context - Pot Odyssey

## What You're Working On Now

**Current Phase**: Advanced Movement & Resource Systems Complete ✅  
**Status**: Full-featured platformer with advanced mechanics and resource systems  
**Priority**: Beginning ability system implementation (Thornspike, Glideleaf)

### Immediate Focus
1. **Project Initialization**
   - Set up package.json and dependencies
   - Configure build system for Phaser 3 development
   - Establish basic folder structure
   - Set up development server

2. **Core Dependencies Setup**
   - Phaser 3 installation and configuration
   - Development tools (bundler, dev server)
   - Asset pipeline preparation
   - Basic HTML/CSS structure for browser target

3. **Foundation Architecture**
   - Basic scene structure (menu, game, HUD)
   - Initial player controller setup
   - Basic movement mechanics implementation
   - Asset loading system

## Recent Changes

**Current State**: Advanced platformer with full movement mechanics and resource systems
- ✅ Created comprehensive PRD
- ✅ Established memory bank for project context  
- ✅ **Completed**: Project initialization and basic platformer
- ✅ **Completed**: Advanced movement mechanics (variable jump, coyote time, jump buffering, wall slide)
- ✅ **Completed**: Resource systems (moisture with diegetic visualization, durability with impact damage)
- ✅ **Completed**: Enhanced test level with comprehensive platform layouts
- ✅ Working cross-platform controls (keyboard + mobile touch)
- ✅ Advanced physics system with collision and camera management
- ✅ Scene management (Boot, Menu, Game) with proper asset loading
- 🚧 **Next**: Core ability system implementation (Thornspike ground pound, Glideleaf gliding)

## Next Steps (Immediate Priorities)

### Phase 4: Core Abilities Implementation (Current)
1. **Thornspike Ability** (Ground Pound)
   - Implement downward slam attack
   - Add ability to break brittle blocks/platforms
   - Visual feedback and sound effects
   - Cooldown system implementation

2. **Glideleaf Ability** (Gliding)
   - Reduced gravity while ability key held
   - Horizontal movement control during glide
   - Visual feedback (leaf particle effect)
   - Stamina/duration limitations

### Phase 2: Core Foundation ✅ **COMPLETE**
1. **Basic Scene Management** ✅
   - ✅ Boot scene for asset loading
   - ✅ Menu scene with "Pot Odyssey" branding
   - ✅ Game scene with working gameplay
   - ✅ Preloader with placeholder asset generation
   - ⏸️ HUD overlay scene (deferred - not needed yet)

2. **Player Controller Foundation** ✅ 
   - ✅ Basic pot sprite rendering (brown rounded rectangle)
   - ✅ Movement input handling (keyboard + mobile)
   - ✅ Physics body setup with proper collision
   - ✅ Camera following with smooth lerp

3. **Essential Systems** ✅
   - ✅ Asset loading pipeline with placeholder graphics
   - ⏸️ Save/load system structure (deferred to later phase)
   - ✅ Input management abstraction (unified keyboard/touch)

### Phase 3: Advanced Movement Mechanics ✅ **COMPLETE**
1. **Enhanced Platforming** ✅
   - ✅ Single jump with proper state management (no infinite jumping)
   - ✅ Variable jump implementation (hold spacebar for higher jumps with diminishing returns)
   - ✅ Coyote time (40ms) and jump buffering (180ms) for responsive controls
   - ✅ Wall slide mechanics (60px/s speed cap when holding toward wall while airborne)
   - ✅ Robust collision detection and platform interaction

2. **Resource System** ✅
   - ✅ Moisture meter with diegetic ring visualization around player (green→yellow→red)
   - ✅ Durability system with HUD pip visualization (4 brown circles, gray when empty)
   - ✅ Moisture drain mechanics (5% every 10 seconds, respawn at 0%)
   - ✅ Impact damage system (hard landings >300px/s after 300ms airtime)
   - ✅ Visual feedback with screen shake on damage and color-coded moisture ring

3. **Enhanced Test Level** ✅
   - ✅ Comprehensive climbing routes (left tower, center zigzag, right mega tower)
   - ✅ Camera system with world bounds (2048x1024) and smooth following
   - ✅ Safety systems (auto-respawn, invisible boundary walls)
   - ✅ Multiple height platforms for damage testing (y=250, y=150, y=50)

### Phase 4: Core Abilities (Current Focus)
1. **Ability System Framework**
   - Input handling for ability keys (Q, E)
   - Cooldown management system
   - Visual feedback framework
   - Resource cost integration with moisture/durability

2. **First Two Abilities**
   - **Thornspike**: Ground pound attack, breaks brittle blocks
   - **Glideleaf**: Gliding with reduced gravity and horizontal control
   - Proper animation and particle effects
   - Integration with existing movement system

## Development Approach

**Methodology**: Iterative development with frequent playtesting  
**Testing Strategy**: Browser-first development with mobile testing from early stages  
**Performance Focus**: Monitor performance from day one with 60fps target

## Current Blockers/Dependencies

**None currently** - ready to begin development setup.
