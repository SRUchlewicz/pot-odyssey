# Active Context - Pot Odyssey

## What You're Working On Now

**Current Phase**: Project Setup & Foundation  
**Status**: Starting from scratch - no code exists yet  
**Priority**: Establishing development environment and basic project structure

### Immediate Focus
1. **Project Initialization**
   - Set up package.json and dependencies
   - Configure build system for Phaser 3 development
   - Establish basic folder structure
   - Set up development server

2. **Core Dependencies Setup**
   - Phaser 3 installation and configuration
   - Development tools (bundler, dev server)
   - Asset pipeline preparation
   - Basic HTML/CSS structure for browser target

3. **Foundation Architecture**
   - Basic scene structure (menu, game, HUD)
   - Initial player controller setup
   - Basic movement mechanics implementation
   - Asset loading system

## Recent Changes

**Current State**: Empty project directory (only PRD and memory_bank exist)
- âœ… Created comprehensive PRD
- âœ… Established memory bank for project context
- ðŸš§ **Next**: Project initialization

**No code changes yet** - starting development from ground zero.

## Next Steps (Immediate Priorities)

### Phase 1: Environment Setup (Current)
1. **Initialize Node.js project** with package.json
2. **Install Phaser 3** and development dependencies
3. **Configure build system** (Vite/Webpack for development)
4. **Create basic HTML entry point** for browser target
5. **Set up development server** with hot reload

### Phase 2: Core Foundation (Next ~1-2 weeks)
1. **Basic Scene Management**
   - Boot scene for asset loading
   - Menu scene for navigation
   - Game scene for gameplay
   - HUD overlay scene

2. **Player Controller Foundation**
   - Basic sprite rendering
   - Movement input handling
   - Physics body setup
   - Camera following

3. **Essential Systems**
   - Asset loading pipeline
   - Save/load system structure
   - Input management abstraction

### Phase 3: Movement Mechanics (Following ~1-2 weeks)
1. **Core Platforming**
   - Variable jump implementation
   - Coyote time and jump buffering
   - Wall slide mechanics
   - Basic collision detection

2. **Resource System**
   - Moisture meter implementation
   - Durability system
   - Visual feedback for both systems

### Phase 4: First Playable (Target: 4-6 weeks from start)
1. **Basic Level**
   - Simple test level with platforms
   - Collectible placement
   - Basic hazards

2. **Core Abilities**
   - Thornspike (ground pound)
   - Glideleaf (gliding)
   - Basic ability system framework

## Development Approach

**Methodology**: Iterative development with frequent playtesting  
**Testing Strategy**: Browser-first development with mobile testing from early stages  
**Performance Focus**: Monitor performance from day one with 60fps target

## Current Blockers/Dependencies

**None currently** - ready to begin development setup.
