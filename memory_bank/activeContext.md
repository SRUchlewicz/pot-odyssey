# Active Context - Pot Odyssey

## What You're Working On Now

**Current Phase**: Foundation Architecture Complete ‚úÖ  
**Status**: Basic platformer foundation working with player movement  
**Priority**: Implementing advanced movement mechanics and resource systems

### Immediate Focus
1. **Project Initialization**
   - Set up package.json and dependencies
   - Configure build system for Phaser 3 development
   - Establish basic folder structure
   - Set up development server

2. **Core Dependencies Setup**
   - Phaser 3 installation and configuration
   - Development tools (bundler, dev server)
   - Asset pipeline preparation
   - Basic HTML/CSS structure for browser target

3. **Foundation Architecture**
   - Basic scene structure (menu, game, HUD)
   - Initial player controller setup
   - Basic movement mechanics implementation
   - Asset loading system

## Recent Changes

**Current State**: Working Phaser 3 platformer foundation
- ‚úÖ Created comprehensive PRD
- ‚úÖ Established memory bank for project context
- ‚úÖ **Completed**: Project initialization and basic platformer
- ‚úÖ Working player movement with keyboard + mobile controls
- ‚úÖ Physics system with gravity and collision
- ‚úÖ Camera following player
- ‚úÖ Scene management (Boot, Menu, Game)
- üöß **Next**: Advanced movement mechanics (variable jump, coyote time, wall slide)

## Next Steps (Immediate Priorities)

### Phase 1: Environment Setup (Current)
1. **Initialize Node.js project** with package.json
2. **Install Phaser 3** and development dependencies
3. **Configure build system** (Vite/Webpack for development)
4. **Create basic HTML entry point** for browser target
5. **Set up development server** with hot reload

### Phase 2: Core Foundation ‚úÖ **COMPLETE**
1. **Basic Scene Management** ‚úÖ
   - ‚úÖ Boot scene for asset loading
   - ‚úÖ Menu scene with "Pot Odyssey" branding
   - ‚úÖ Game scene with working gameplay
   - ‚úÖ Preloader with placeholder asset generation
   - ‚è∏Ô∏è HUD overlay scene (deferred - not needed yet)

2. **Player Controller Foundation** ‚úÖ 
   - ‚úÖ Basic pot sprite rendering (brown rounded rectangle)
   - ‚úÖ Movement input handling (keyboard + mobile)
   - ‚úÖ Physics body setup with proper collision
   - ‚úÖ Camera following with smooth lerp

3. **Essential Systems** ‚úÖ
   - ‚úÖ Asset loading pipeline with placeholder graphics
   - ‚è∏Ô∏è Save/load system structure (deferred to later phase)
   - ‚úÖ Input management abstraction (unified keyboard/touch)

### Phase 3: Advanced Movement Mechanics (Current Focus)
1. **Enhanced Platforming** üöß
   - ‚úÖ Single jump with proper state management (no infinite jumping)
   - [ ] Variable jump implementation (hold for higher jump)
   - [ ] Coyote time and jump buffering (~120ms each)
   - [ ] Wall slide mechanics with reduced gravity
   - ‚úÖ Robust collision detection and platform interaction

2. **Resource System**
   - [ ] Moisture meter implementation with visual display
   - [ ] Durability system with crack visualization  
   - [ ] Resource drain mechanics (time, heat, impacts)
   - [ ] Visual feedback for both systems

### Phase 4: First Playable (Target: 4-6 weeks from start)
1. **Basic Level**
   - Simple test level with platforms
   - Collectible placement
   - Basic hazards

2. **Core Abilities**
   - Thornspike (ground pound)
   - Glideleaf (gliding)
   - Basic ability system framework

## Development Approach

**Methodology**: Iterative development with frequent playtesting  
**Testing Strategy**: Browser-first development with mobile testing from early stages  
**Performance Focus**: Monitor performance from day one with 60fps target

## Current Blockers/Dependencies

**None currently** - ready to begin development setup.
