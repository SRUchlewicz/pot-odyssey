# Active Context - Pot Odyssey

## What You're Working On Now

**Current Phase**: Core Abilities Implementation Complete âœ…  
**Status**: Full-featured platformer with advanced mechanics, resource systems, and working abilities  
**Priority**: Next ability implementation or content expansion

### Immediate Focus
1. **Core Abilities System** âœ… **COMPLETE**
   - âœ… Thornspike (Ground Pound) - breaks brittle blocks with Ctrl key/mobile down arrow
   - âœ… Glideleaf (Gliding) - reduces fall speed with Q key/mobile Q button
   - âœ… Ability system framework with cooldowns and resource costs
   - âœ… Cross-platform controls (desktop + mobile)
   - âœ… Visual feedback (HUD indicators, console logs, screen shake)

2. **Next Development Options**
   - **Option A**: Implement next ability (Bloom Dash, Tanglevine, etc.)
   - **Option B**: Expand test level with more ability challenges
   - **Option C**: Add collectibles and progression systems
   - **Option D**: Implement save/load system

## Recent Changes

**Current State**: Advanced platformer with full movement mechanics, resource systems, and working abilities
- âœ… Created comprehensive PRD
- âœ… Established memory bank for project context  
- âœ… **Completed**: Project initialization and basic platformer
- âœ… **Completed**: Advanced movement mechanics (variable jump, coyote time, jump buffering, wall slide)
- âœ… **Completed**: Resource systems (moisture with diegetic visualization, durability with impact damage)
- âœ… **Completed**: Enhanced test level with comprehensive platform layouts
- âœ… **Completed**: Core abilities system (Thornspike ground pound, Glideleaf gliding)
- âœ… Working cross-platform controls (keyboard + mobile touch)
- âœ… Advanced physics system with collision and camera management
- âœ… Scene management (Boot, Menu, Game) with proper asset loading
- ðŸš§ **Next**: Choose next development priority

## Next Steps (Choose One)

### Option A: Next Ability Implementation
1. **Bloom Dash** (8-way burst movement)
   - Press E while airborne for directional burst
   - Brief invulnerability and short cooldown
   - Small moisture cost

2. **Tanglevine** (utility/puzzle solving)
   - Fire vine to pull levers or create bridges
   - Range-based targeting system
   - Cooldown management

### Option B: Content Expansion
1. **Enhanced Test Level**
   - Add more brittle blocks for ground pound testing
   - Create gliding challenges with wind tunnels
   - Add collectible items (Seed Shards, species)

2. **Progression Systems**
   - Herbarium v1 (collectible tracking)
   - Basic cosmetics system
   - Loadout system (soil types, passives)

### Option C: Technical Systems
1. **Save/Load System**
   - IndexedDB implementation
   - Progress persistence
   - Settings storage

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Sprite atlasing
   - Object pooling
   - Mobile optimization

## Development Approach

**Methodology**: Iterative development with frequent playtesting  
**Testing Strategy**: Browser-first development with mobile testing from early stages  
**Performance Focus**: Monitor performance from day one with 60fps target

## Current Blockers/Dependencies

**None currently** - ready to choose next development priority.
