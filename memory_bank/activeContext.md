# Active Context - Pot Odyssey

## What You're Working On Now

**Current Phase**: All Core Abilities Complete âœ…  
**Status**: Full-featured platformer with advanced mechanics, resource systems, and complete ability suite  
**Priority**: Next development phase (content expansion or technical systems)

### Immediate Focus
1. **Core Abilities System** âœ… **COMPLETE**
   - âœ… Thornspike (Ground Pound) - breaks brittle blocks with Ctrl key/mobile down arrow
   - âœ… Glideleaf (Gliding) - reduces fall speed with Q key/mobile Q button
   - âœ… **Bloom Dash** (8-way burst movement) - directional burst with E key/mobile button
   - âœ… Ability system framework with cooldowns and resource costs
   - âœ… Cross-platform controls (desktop + mobile)
   - âœ… Visual feedback (HUD indicators, console logs, screen shake)

2. **Next Development Options**
   - **Option A**: Implement Tanglevine ability (utility/puzzle solving)
   - **Option B**: Expand test level with more ability challenges and collectibles
   - **Option C**: Add progression systems (Herbarium, cosmetics, loadouts)
   - **Option D**: Implement technical systems (save/load, performance optimization)

## Recent Changes

**Current State**: Advanced platformer with full movement mechanics, resource systems, and complete ability suite
- âœ… Created comprehensive PRD
- âœ… Established memory bank for project context  
- âœ… **Completed**: Project initialization and basic platformer

   - Fire vine to pull levers or create bridges
   - Range-based targeting system
   - Cooldown management

### Option B: Content Expansion
1. **Enhanced Test Level**
   - Add more brittle blocks for ground pound testing
   - Create gliding challenges with wind tunnels
   - Add collectible items (Seed Shards, species)

2. **Progression Systems**
   - Herbarium v1 (collectible tracking)
   - Basic cosmetics system
   - Loadout system (soil types, passives)

### Option C: Technical Systems
1. **Save/Load System**
   - IndexedDB implementation
   - Progress persistence
   - Settings storage

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Sprite atlasing
   - Object pooling
   - Mobile optimization

## Development Approach

**Methodology**: Iterative development with frequent playtesting  
**Testing Strategy**: Browser-first development with mobile testing from early stages  
**Performance Focus**: Monitor performance from day one with 60fps target

## Current Blockers/Dependencies
