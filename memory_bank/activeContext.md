   - âœ… Glideleaf (Gliding) - reduces fall speed with Q key/mobile Q button
   - âœ… **Bloom Dash** (8-way burst movement) - directional burst with E key/mobile button
   - âœ… **Tanglevine** (Utility/Puzzle Solving) - creates bridges and pulls levers with F key/mobile button
   - âœ… Ability system framework with cooldowns and resource costs
   - âœ… Cross-platform controls (desktop + mobile)
   - âœ… Visual feedback (HUD indicators, console logs, screen shake)

2. **Enhanced Test Level** âœ… **COMPLETE**
   - âœ… Comprehensive level with 11 distinct sections
   - âœ… Ability-specific testing areas (Thornspike, Glideleaf, Bloom Dash, Tanglevine)
   - âœ… Multi-ability synergy challenges
   - âœ… Wind tunnel gliding section
   - âœ… Dash mastery course with diagonal challenges
   - âœ… Tanglevine puzzle area with bridge gaps
   - âœ… **Collectible system (Seed Shards + Species)** - fully functional with collision detection
   - âœ… Progress tracking and visual feedback
   - âœ… Static physics objects for stable collectible positioning
   - âœ… Manual collision detection for reliable collection

3. **Next Development Options**
   - **Option A**: Implement progression systems (Herbarium, loadouts, cosmetics)
   - **Option B**: Add technical systems (save/load, performance optimization)
   - **Option C**: Create additional levels or boss encounters
   - **Option D**: Implement advanced puzzle mechanics
